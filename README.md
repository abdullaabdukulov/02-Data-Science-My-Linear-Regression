# 02-Data-Science-My-Linear-Regression

## Task

The project aims to implement and compare two regression algorithms: Least Squares Regression and Gradient Descent Optimization, using a simple linear model and a quadratic function.

## Description

The project consists of two main parts:

### Least Squares Regression

1. Generate random data using a simple linear model.
2. Implement Least Squares Regression model to fit the data.
3. Visualize the results with a scatter plot and the regression line.

### Gradient Descent Optimization

1. Define a quadratic function and its gradient.
2. Implement a Gradient Descent Optimization algorithm to find the minimum of the quadratic function.
3. Visualize the optimization process in 3D space.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nasretdinov-/02-Data-Science-My-Linear-Regression.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 02-Data-Science-My-Linear-Regression
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```


## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `my_linear_regression.ipynb`:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook my_linear_regression.ipynb
   ```

2. Execute the cells in the notebook to run the Least Squares Regression and Gradient Descent Optimization sections.

3. Explore the generated visualizations and console output within the notebook to understand the behavior of the implemented algorithms.
