# Welcome to My Linear Regression

## Task

For example, suppose we want to know what a pet dog is. We can memorize some pictures of dogs and then classify them as canine animals that resemble the pictures.
Then we need a way to "measure" similarity. This is called example-based learning.

## Description

Another way of generalizing is by creating a model from the existing examples and make prediction based on that model.

For instance, let's say we want to analyze the relation between two attributes and plot one against the other:

## Installation

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

## Usage

It work with !gandalf and peeer rewiew ```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
